# Welcome to ScratchTools v1.6!
We've added some **awesome** new features to ScratchTools, and we think you'll **love** them!
### 1. Hover over project title
Now, you can hover over project titles on profiles to show the **full** title. This helps if a project's title is too long to display.
### 2. We fixed the statistics bug
For some users with usernames that were long, the statistics button would take you to the wrong page. We have fixed this bug, thanks to [JoePotatoScratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JoePotatoScratch) for pointing it out!
### 3. We added the Scratch Team `*` to the forums
On a Scratch Team user's profile, an asterisk would appear next to their username. The same doesn't happen in the discuss forum, so we added it!
### 4. We fixed the TurboWarp button
Sometimes, the TurboWarp button wouldn't display in the editor because of a bug, but it's fixed now and better than ever!
