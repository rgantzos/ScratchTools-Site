## Basic Questions and Answers
### What is ScratchTools?
ScratchTools is a Chrome Extension that is used for Scratch. ScratchTools adds features to Scratch that make it easier to use, from adding an "Open in Turbowarp" button in the editor to replacing project links with their titles. We recommend [downloading it!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratchtools-for-scratch/jjnpbalpllpfdpgplpbcbadkgdmleopm)
### How can I help ScratchTools?
It is really easy to help with ScratchTools, and we are constantly looking for ideas. We add features very often, and we love getting feedback and suggestions from our users. We look for brainstormers, coders, influencers, artists, or just anyone who has an idea! It's really easy to submit an idea, and due to our large amount of developers, we use a large percentage of the suggestions that users submit, and we give credit to the user who submitted it.
### Will ScratchTools be put on Firefox or Edge?
We do plan on putting ScratchTools onto Firefox and Edge, but we are closest to being able to put ScratchTools onto Firefox. We do see ScratchTools being put on Edge at some point in the future.
## Contributing
Many people love to contribute to the constantly growing ScratchTools extension, and it's very, very easy to do so.

Most of the time, users who are contributing work directly with the head developers to create a new feature. The best way to get in touch with developers is directly through [Discord](https://discord.gg/rwAs5jDrTQ), and we usually respond within an hour at most.

We have a bot that accepts suggestions for features, and then the feature will be decided on by the ScratchTools developers.
## What Does the Process Look Like?

 1. A developer or a user will come up with an idea for a feature, and then the suggestion will be shared with the developers and other users who are interested.
 2. Developers and users will vote on whether or not the idea is practical. If it passes this point, which most suggestions do, then it will move on.
 3. The programmers figure out the best way to implement the feature, and where to put the feature, and how it will be accessed by users (for example, a button on a project page).
 4. The programmers then code the feature, and test it out on their end until the feature works well for them.
 5. All the code is put into the [GitHub Repository,](https://github.com/rgantzosonscratch/ScratchTools) along with other features.
 6. Beta testers ([you can sign up to become one](https://discord.gg/rwAs5jDrTQ)) download the new version of ScratchTools and test it out. As long as no bugs are found, the version continues. Otherwise, the features that have bugs either go back to being coded and rejoin the version, or wait until the next version.
 7. After a version is ready to be published, it is submitted to the [Chrome Webstore,](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratchtools-for-scratch/jjnpbalpllpfdpgplpbcbadkgdmleopm) where it is reviewed by Chrome.
 8. After the version is accepted by Chrome, it is published for all users.
