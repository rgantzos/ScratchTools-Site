### What is ScratchTools?
ScratchTools is a Chrome Extension that is used for Scratch. ScratchTools adds features to Scratch that make it easier to use, from adding an "Open in Turbowarp" button in the editor to replacing project links with their titles. We recommend [downloading it!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratchtools-for-scratch/jjnpbalpllpfdpgplpbcbadkgdmleopm)
### How can I help ScratchTools?
It is really easy to help with ScratchTools, and we are constantly looking for ideas. We add features very often, and we love getting feedback and suggestions from our users. We look for brainstormers, coders, influencers, artists, or just anyone who has an idea! It's really easy to submit an idea, and due to our large amount of developers, we use a large percentage of the suggestions that users submit, and we give credit to the user who submitted it.
### Will ScratchTools be put on Firefox or Edge?
We do plan on putting ScratchTools onto Firefox and Edge, but we are closest to being able to put ScratchTools onto Firefox. We do see ScratchTools being put on Edge at some point in the future.
